( #WIP find a name, replace all instances of Metaldwarves in this doc with that name)

## Essence

Metaldwarves can absorb metal into their bones, then later release them through various disc-like apertures throughout their body. When activated, a Metaldwarf's chosen disk will begin glowing, and it will strongly either pull or push on the metal which has been stored. While stored, metal remains in a suspended semi-liquid state, within spiral grooves in the bones. While a Metaldwarf has no metal stored, their bones will be weak and brittle, but with metal they become incredibly strong.

Although Metaldwarves by and large lack fine control over the metal they expell, they can achieve extremely high forces. However, Metaldwarves know how to use their essence cleverly in order to multiply the forces they exert. Here are some examples:

1. In order to lift an incredibly heavy boulder, #WIP SampleName slowly adds more and more metal under it, like a jack, focusing all of his mana into adding small amounds of metal but letting the entire weight of the boulder rest on the metal and not on his body
2. In order to forcefully pull a stuck door open, #WIP SampleName presses her palms against the door and releases several small nails to gain additional friction, pounds a single large bolt onto the floor through her left foot, then creates a link between the discs in her ankle and upper back thigh and pulls hard through both discs in order to transfer that pulling force onto the door
3. In the heat of battle, #WIP SampleName sees that an enormous wave of fire is coming towards them, and spending three [[Mana Bursts]], they quickly propel half of their metal off of their feet in order to jump high in the air, avoiding the deadly fire, then landing hard on the ground, avoiding broken bones through their remaining metal, but not avoiding waking up incredibly bruised the next morning

## Mechanical Benefits

## Appearance and Customs

Metaldwarves are between 140 and 170cm in height, and weigh anywhere from 120kg to 800kg depending on how much metal is in their bones. Accross their body, they have ivory discs embedded into their skin. The outside of these discs is light and relatively soft and is traditionally carved with various patterns of cultural significance, while the middle half of the disc is much darker. When a disc is activated through their essence, the middle part glows a bright red, and the glow lights up the carvings also. The discs are usually 10cm in diameter, and are located as follows:

- A disc on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet
- Three discs on each arm, one right below the wrist on the inside of the forearm, another right before the elbow on the outside of the forearm, and one right below the shoulder on the front
- Three discs on each leg, one on the back of the ankle, another right above the knee on the front of the thigh, and the last below the butt at the top of the back of the thigh
- A disc on the back of each shoulder blade
- Ten 5cm wide discs on the tip of each finger
