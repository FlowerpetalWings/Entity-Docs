## Essence

Pixies release a fine golden pollen off of their flower-petal wings, which shrinks the size and mass of objects it permeates. By passively releasing a small amount of it into the air around their wings, Pixies can fly even while carrying relatively heavy items. By spending additional mana, a Pixie can shrink an item normally meant to be used by a larger species.

 - **Pixie Dust** (Flight: passive. Shrink: 1 mana per 5kg reduced): Shrink an item's size and weight while it's in contact with your pollen. When used passively on the air, it allows flight. During extreme wind conditions additional mana may be required, in addition to an [[Athletics]] check. Pollen remains active for some time after mana has stopped being directed towards it. For every second you've fed mana into this essence, the pollen shrinks the item for two seconds.
	 - **{4} #WIP name -** When making an [[Agility]] based check: You may take a free [[Shift]] action.
	 - **{4}{4}{4} Did you need that? -** When making a melee attack check, or having one done against you: After the effects of the triggering action, you may use your essence spontaneously to shrink an item your opponent is holding.

## Appearance and Customs

Pixies are between 20 to 25cm in height, and weigh around 20 grams. They have smooth delicate features, with pointy ears and noses. Their wings are covered in tiny flower petals, with a wingspan around 1.5x their height. They live for around fourty years naturally, but most Pixie communities have [[Druid]]s to extend these lifespands nearly indefinetely.

Pixies are sexless, with each individual having the ability to help fertilise Pixie tree flowers. Despite this, they are incredibly genderful, and they tend to style their hair in various spunky and colourful ways. Pixies often still end up deciding on a set of pronouns to use when speaking gendered languages, depending on how they wish to be perceived, and there are some Pixies that decide to embrace a feminine or masculine gender completely.

Pixie trees flower yearly, and dozens of Pixies will tend to the flowers and pollinate them. Over the next several months, the tree's flowers will close up, and when they finally open again a Pixie child will spring out with the flowerpetals as their wings. Each time a tree flowers it has a distinctive pattern of colours shared by each of its Pixies. Each of these sets of siblings is called a bloom, and they usually share a close lifelong connection.

Not having traditional parents, Pixie children are raised and taught by whole communities, and their culture has a higher emphasis on intentional, chosen relationships. However, Pixie children face pressure to choose a life path that will complement and not overlap with those of their bloomkin, and adults who tutor more than one child from a given bloom into their profession are stigmatized.
