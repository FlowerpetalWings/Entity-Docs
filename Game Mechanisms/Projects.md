#WIP bullet phase

- While you undertake your everyday activities, towards the end of the day, your character makes progress towards long-term projects
- Each character can only have one long-term project at a time
- Skill-based projects include:
	- Training an Animal to learn new talents with [[Animal Handling]]
	- [[Crafting]] a new item
	- Decipher an encrypted text with [[Investigation]]
	- Write a new law to propose to a council with [[Politics]]
- Magic talent-based projects include:
	- Mutating yourself or another Entity to gain attributes or abilities from another Entity (Strength + Force)
	- Learning to use a new Rune (Intellect + Focus)
	- Discovering new aspects of a dream-caught alter self (Wit + Control)
	- Creating a new module for a runic contraption (Wit + Control)
- Projects require a certain amount of successes to finish, and each day each character will make a relevant roll to determine how much they progress on their projects. A typical project will take 20 successes to finish, but it can range anywhere from 10 to 200 successes depending on the project's scale
