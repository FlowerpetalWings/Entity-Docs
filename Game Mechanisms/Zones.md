#WIP bullet phase, but weirdly prose-ey?

## Zones

- Zones are narratively and often mechanically distinct regions Entities can traverse in the midst of a conflict.
- In order to avoid the overhead of a grid with miniatures, we use zones.
- Zones have a size number associated with them, which represents how many ticks (around 1 second each) it takes to enter or leave the zone. When moving from one zone to another, the sizes of both zones are taken into account to determine how much time it takes.
- Zone sizes range from one to three, but particularly large zones can be size four. Avoid making zones larger than that, and if a zone ever gets much larger than around 100 squared metres, try and split it up, ideally with narratively distinct zones! Terrain variety makes conflicts much more interesting
- Remember that for a character to move zones, that has to be all they are doing at a given time! Even if it doesn't make strict logical sense for a football field sized forest clearing to be entered in four seconds and then fully crossed in four more seconds, that still will *feel* like a very long time in the heat of combat.
- Some Zones have special mechanical benefits. These mechanical benefits go beyond conflicts and can apply outside of them. They can come in various ways:
	- Skill advantages: A zone can give an advantage a given skill. Forest might make stealth easier, castle walls might make marksmanship more effective, a library might make politics checks more fruitful. These benefits show the strength of the advantage, what skill it affects, and if there are any specialisations that rolls that take advantage of this benefit must always have. For example, a map room might give an advantage to Politics (Geography) but not to Politics (Religion).
	- Triggers: Some zones have special abilities that trigger whenever an event happens. Being on a precarious rope bridge might require you to make a successful Agility + Athletics (Balance) check or fall to the waters below, for example.
	- Dice abilities: Like talents, some zones can provide dice abilities. These usually happen on 1 dice results, like most items.
	- Actions: Occasionally, zones will have objects or features that can be interacted with. A lever that opens or closes a portcullis, for example.

## Adjacency

- While zones are used to simplify where your character is and reduce friction within conflicts, in order to determine close proximity, we use adjacency.
- Narratively, adjacency represents objects or Entities which are close enough to each other that they can make physical contact.
- In order to use an item on your zone, make an attack against an enemy Entity, or help out a friendly Entity in a way that requires physical contact, you must first become adjacent to that item or entity. See "Move - Incidental Action" for how this is usually done.
- Being adjacent to an item or Entity that another item or Entity is also adjacent to makes you adjacent to all of these items or Entities
- When you are not adjacent to an item or entity, you are separate from that item or entity. You might still be in the same zone
- Becoming adjacent to an item or Entity makes you separate to whichever items or Entities you were previously adjacent to

## Traps

- Traps are the most vicious - and fun for the GM! - feature of a zone. They usually have a certain trigger, or they can be triggered by characters in that zone taking an action only they know about.
- Traps are often hidden from the PCs, but sometimes the opposite is the case! Players will be well rewarded planning ahead and laying traps in zones they know conflict will happen in.
- Traps take the form of zone features that only some people know about. Once a trap has been used though, usually all parties will be aware of it, and will be able to take advantage of it if it isn't a one-time thing.
