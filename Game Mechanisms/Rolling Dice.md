#WIP bullet phase

- Dice rolls usually have two attributes / skills that go into them, with the player rolling a number of d8s equal to the sum of these two numbers
- Having situational advantages or disadvantages upgrades or downgrades a number of dice equal to the strength of that advantage / disadvantage. Downgrading a die turns it into a d10, upgrading it turns it into a d6. One advantage and one disadvantage cancel out.
- When making a roll using a skill, having a specialisation for that skill be relevant for the roll allows the player to reroll any number of dice of their choice after the initial roll
- When the highest two results of a die show up (5 or 6 for a d6, 7 or 8 for a d8, 9 or 0 for a d10), it counts as a success. If a higher than or equal number of successes were rolled than the difficulty class that the GM set, the overall roll is a success
- Results of 1, 2, 3 and 4 can often be used to activate special abilities, which will specify when they apply to a given kind of roll
- Occasionally the rules will instruct a character to make a "raw check", in which case that player is unable to use any such abilities and simply counts the number of successes
- Other times, the rules will instruct a character to make a "pure SKILL roll" or a "pure ATTRIBUTE roll", this only means that there will not be two attributes / skills to add together for that roll
