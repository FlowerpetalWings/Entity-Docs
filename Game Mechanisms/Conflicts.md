#WIP bullet phase


- The basic structure of a conflict is as follows:
	1. Notice which character's Tick marker is furthest back. In the case of a tie, the character with the highest Agility acts first
	2. Allow that character to decide which action to take, and place their Standard and Incidental Action markers on the relevant actions. This acts as a reminder of what they are doing, the specifics should be remembered by that character.
	3. Determine how many Ticks those actions will take, adding together the Tick cost of their Standard and Incidental actions
	4. Move their marker up that many Ticks
	5. Notice which character's Tick marker is furthest back, and resolve their actions, rolling any necessary checks
	6. Repeat to step 2
- Characters who are surprised start at Tick 4 by default, characters who took the initiative to start the conflict (ie opening the door into combat) go at Tick 0, everyone else at Tick 2. Characters who are being surprised get to roll a Reflex + Perception(Alertness) raw check to see if they are surprised and delayed those two Ticks, with the difficulty of course being up to the GM.
- There are many different actions that can be taken, and three different way to use each action
	- Standard Action: The main thing a character is doing on their turn, taking up most of their attention. These actions are the slowest to take and so usually cost the bulk of a given turn's Ticks. They are also the most effective.
	- Incidental Action: These actions are things characters can perform without their full attention. Some of these actions only exist as incidental actions, while others have a stronger Standard Action version and a weaker but faster Incidental Action version.
	- Spontaneous Action: These are actions that a character can perform to react to the actions taken by another character. Chracters have the choice to take Spontaneous Actions when another character announces what their next actions will be. Some Talents also allow you to take Spontaneous Actions in the middle of the resolution of another character's actions. In order to perform these, the character must first make a roll to determine if they are fast enough to interrupt what they are currently doing. The specific attributes or skills that go into that roll are specified by the action, but it will always include Reflex. When taking a Spontaneous Action, resolve the effect of the action immediately, but move the character's Tick marker forward a number of Ticks equal to the Tick cost of the Spontaneous Action. The Tick marker is moved forward whether or not the initial roll actually succeeded, potentially costing the character precious time in their attempts at reacting to the heat of battle. Some Standard or Incidental Actions have Spontaneous versions, but the majority of Spontaneous Actions come from Talents.


## List of Actions

- **Move**
	- Standard Action (X Ticks): Move from one zone to another
- **Cast Spell**
	- Standard Action (4+ Ticks): You spend the Mana on the spell as soon as this action is selected, but it only goes into effect once this action resolves, at which point it continues indefinitely, with an effectiveness proportional to how much mana was spent. Each mana burst spent on the spell adds an additional Tick.
	- Spontaneous Action (2 Ticks, Reflex + Focus): As with the Standard Action, but the effects of the spell resolve immediately, you may not spend more than 2 Mana, and you may not spend a mana burst.
- **Attack**
	- Standard Action ()
