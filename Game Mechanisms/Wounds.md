#WIP VERY EARLY bullet phase

## Attack & Damage Process:

1. Roll for attack: Need two successes by default
2. Fatigue Phase: Your attack would hit, but the target can still avoid taking a wound. You will remove stamina by dealing fatigue to the target. Additional successes increase fatigue, target's Armour decreases fatigue. If the target is defending, their successes further reduce fatigue. If any fatigue isn't successfully soaked, go to wound phase
3. Wound Phase: There are two kinds of wounds
	1. Ability created wounds (done through talents or weapons that look for special dice results) create wounds the effects of which are specified in the relevant talent or weapon
	2. For wounds coming from unsoaked fatigue, determine the deadliness of the instigating talent or weapon, and look at the Wound Severity table to determine the effect
4. Healing: Once a day, as an action, you may make a Strength + Endurance (Fatigue) roll and restore stamina equal to the number of successes. You may do this two more times this day, but the second time takes 10 minutes and the third time takes a night's sleep.

## Wound Severity Table

- 1-5 severity: Wounded 1
- 6-7 severity: Wounded 1, Staggered for 8 Ticks
- 8-9 severity: Wounded 2, Staggered for 8 Ticks
- 10-11 severity: Wounded 2, you suffer a narratively appropriate minor permanent injury (something that'll leave a scar or a concussion) which debilitates a relevant attribute until healed
- 12-14 severity: Wounded 2, you suffer a narratively appropriate major permanent injury (such as losing part of a limb or serious brain damage) which permanently debilitates a relevant attribute
- 15+ severity: Death
