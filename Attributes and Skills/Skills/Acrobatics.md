## Specialisations

- **Balance** - Many items, talents, and zone features will require characters to make Acrobatics (Balance) rolls in order to keep their footing.
- **Landing** - When characters fall a long distance, they must make an Acrobatics (Landing) roll to determine how much they can ease the severity of the incoming wound.
- **Free Running** - When characters want to jump from roof to roof, to roll in the air, or generally manoeuvre around urban environments, Free Running is used to determine if they succeed without potentially falling large distances. In general, while Balance and Landing are rolled when thing happen *to* your character, Free Running is the specialisation that lets your character *use* their proficiency in acrobatics for their own advantage

## Conflict Actions


Acrobatics is not a skill specifically designed around conflicts. Instead, certain zones might have features that require acrobatics to traverse, and in general it will be used to avoid taking unnecessary damage from being clumsy.
