# Entity Playtest Documents

This repository contains all the documents necessary to playtest Entity. All of these materials are playtest materials, and do not make up a finished, polished product. The goal of the playtest materials at this stage is for preliminary testing to determine the best mechanical framework going into a Kickstarter campaign.

## Setup and How to Use

These documents can be browsed through github directly, but for a better browsing experience, downloading Obsidian is recommended. These are the steps for setting up these documents:

1. Scroll to the top of this page, and at the top right you will see a green button saying "< > Code". Click on this button, and at the bottom of the pop-up, select "Download ZIP".
2. Once the .zip has been downloaded, extract its contents onto a folder of your choice
3. Download Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/
4. Once open, select "Create Vault from existing folder" and select the folder you extracted the .zip from
5. Open the Outline document, which will show you the optimal order to read these docs

Alternatively, for advanced users who understand git and wish to update their local copy whenever an update is released, simply clone the repository and follow the same steps for Obsidian.
