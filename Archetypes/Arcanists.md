## Overview

Arcanists are what you think of when you think of a "traditional" sorcerer: they use magical runes they study from books in order to unleash torrents of lightning, fling fireballs and make the ground recoil. They memorise incantations at the beginning of each day, write big runes with chalk, and protect their arcane tomes. Unlike most other RPGs, though, in Entity the player has complete freedom to design what these incantations are, and what kinds of magic their Arcanist will wield, through the selection of runes.

Each rune represents a concept, such as Fire and Metal, but also more abstract concepts such as Shape and Proximity. This book outlines many such runes, but with the discretion of your GM you are encouraged to come up with your own runes.

Arcanists use these runes in two main ways.

Firstly and most commonly, they use them in conjunction in order to create incantations. Incantations are verbalisations of these runes, and have inherent magic when spoken by a mage who has formed a bond with the runes they are speaking. By conjugating these runes together, and as a result of arduous study in how the complex runic language functions, Arcanists can mix the runes they've learned into complex yet efficient spells. For example, an Arcanist might mix the runes Increase Property and Flammability in order to make a large boulder flammable, or use the runes Push and Rock to propel that boulder away from them, or even use all these together with Ignition in order to create a fireball.

This might seem like a lot of effort for one simple effect, but it enables creativity through the use of these powers, because for an Arcanist to be able to produce this seemingly simple effect, that Arcanist now can also choose to use their powers in any number of other ways. For example, the Arcanist can use these same runes to burn away part of the walls of a building, leaving a weak foundation that will easily collapse as soon as the Arcanist releases a burst of magic using the Push rune.

Secondly, like most runic magic users, Arcanists can use their runes "freely" by simply making contact with them. This means that in the above example, beyond memorising incantations to accomplish their day's tasks, the Arcanist can also choose to Push any object away, to Ignite any already flammable material, etc. but all at a much less efficient rate. This lends runic magic users a degree of flexibility unmatched by any other kind of magic.
