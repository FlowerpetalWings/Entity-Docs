## Experience Points

At the end of each session you get together to play Entity, each PC will be given a small amount of experience points, or XP, to spend to improve their character. Each time PCs accomplish the objectives they set for themselves, they earn a much larger chunk of XP. Although players are welcome to plan what they will use this XP for well in advance, it is only when PCs decide to rest and sleep in-world that they will have an opportunity to spend any XP they've saved up.

XP can be used to purchase talents and to upgrade your skills and attributes.

## Three Aspects: Body, Mind and Spirit

At their core, your character's power is defined by their aspect (Body, Mind and Spirit) levels. These represent how strong these three separate parts of your character's Entity are. Your Body represents your physical self, how strong, agile and fast you are, along with any mutations, augmentations and special ability your body inherently has. Your Mind represents all of your character's memories and personality, along with every skill they have trained, and any talents they have with them. Finally, your Spirit level represents how good of a mage you are. It dictates how much mana is available to you, how many times a day you can push that to its extreme through Mana Bursts, and most importantly, what magical talents you have at your disposal. What level your character starts with depends on your Archetype, but on average you will start with two of these at level 2, and one at level 3.

As players spend XP, the talents attributes and skills they purchase correspond to one of these three levels. In terms of attributes, Strength Agility and Reflex correspond to Body; Intellect Wit and Charisma correspond to Mind, and Force Control and Focus correspond to Spirit. All Skills correspond to Mind, being the product of training and expertise. Each talent will have in brackets whether it is a Body, a Mind or a Spirit talent.

Each time a player spends XP to purchase a talent, attribute or skill, it contributes to increasing their overall progress towards the next Body, Mind or Spirit level. Each of these needs to be kept track of separately.

## Purchasing Attributes

Players cannot purchase an attribute if its value would exceed twice the level of its corresponding aspect. Furthermore, the sum of all attributes associated with a particular aspect should not exceed four times the level of that aspect. To purchase each point in an attribute, the cost is five xp, plus three times the attribute's new value.

## Purchasing Skills



## Purchasing Talents

- Talents will show in brackets what level they require to purchase, for example Spirit 3. This also shows how expensive this talent is to purchase, and what aspect they are contributing to.
- In order to purchase a talent for a given aspect, you must have at least that many talents for that aspect for every single tier below the tier of the talent you are purchasing
- The cost of each talent increases based on its tier. Specifically, you will need to spend seven XP plus three times the tier of the talent you are purchasing.
