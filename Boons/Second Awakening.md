Through supernatural contact or by exceptional inherent talent, you begin the game already knowing the basics of a second school of magic. Choose Life, Mental or Runic, and you begin the game with a tier 0 an a tier 1 talent of your choice within that school of magic. Your character unlocks access to the school and may spend XP as normal to unlock additional talents within this school of magic.
