Whether through the circumstances of your birth, some unlikely deed, or even a birthmark, you have accidentally fulfilled an ancient prophecy. The original words of the prophesy might be hard to find, but one thing is clear: only you can stop something that will come. And, when the time comes, it will be up to you if you even want to. Few things about prophecy are certain; prophets glimpse them as if watching several loose snapshots, without any real context, without even any correct order. But when a true prophecy is witnessed, one thing is guaranteed: all of those events will happen. The ultimate outcome though, remains in your hands. This boon is extremely disruptive to any established plan your GM might have, so ask your GM for permission to use it, and then work with them to determine what this prophecy entails.
