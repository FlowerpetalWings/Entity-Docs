Whether you searched for it your whole life, it was passed down to you by a parent or mentor, or it simply landed on your doorstep one day mysteriously, you have acquired some secret that many would kill for. The location of a long lost library, a secret that could topple a political operation, or deceptively powerful blackmail against a truly powerful individual, what you do with this secret is up to you. The expectation for this boon is that it is something you will want to pursue, and ultimately unlock rewards that go above and beyond what other boons might offer, even if not what you had in mind. This, however, can go against whatever plan the GM had for your campaign, so consult with you GM with your ideas before picking this boon.
